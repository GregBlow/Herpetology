====== Ecumenical matter ======
Created Friday 24 May 2019

At the village faire is a young woman (Cypress) in white robes with a long, neatly combed hair with flowers in. She has a lute and is singing songs and handing out vague religious pamplets encouraging people to be kind to each other, share their worldly goods, and realise the manifestation of divine presence inside themselves. Religion DC = 12, this is absolutely heretical.  

Will encourage the party to sit in the circle, of which there are already a few villagers sat in rapt attention, and sing songs. 

A low ranking cleric (Father Giles)who has been at the faire to cast cure wounds and blessing for money, and purify food and drink and ritual as rituals on contract will object and argue about the nature of divinity.

Cypress can be easily persuaded to help the party if it can be framed as a continuation of her present activities (she will happily supply rationale herself).
