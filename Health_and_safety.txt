====== Health and safety ======
Created Friday 24 May 2019

Mother Haggle has heard that the village headman of Binglesford has recently acquired a magical Yuan-ti artifact from travelling kobold traders. It must be confiscated for the general safety of the village. Mother Haggle cannot attend to this matter herself, as she and Caramel (the cow) must attend to another matter in the opposite direction. She says that the artifcat should be easy enough to identify, the headman is apparently very proud of it and keeps it on display in his house, and is planning on exhibiting it in the village faire. 

Mother Haggle expects to be away for a week, and so has written you a letter of introduction to the innkeeper, asking her to put the three of you up for a week so that you can attend the village faire. She's also provided a packed lunch.

During the first three days, the artifact, which resembles a narrow foot high statue of a snake coiling around a pillar, is kept in a locked glass display case. It is guarded by Gavin, who does farm work when there are not bailiff duties to attend to. They are typically sat on a stool in the same room, and is brought refreshments periodically by the live in cleaner/cook.  The bailiff is reasonably naive but diligent.

The owner is very proud of the artifact, and will willingly hold forth on matters of art. He is unaware of any supposed magical nature and views the object merely as a statuette, a cultural work of art. 

The owner has a , that is given the run of the house, and is given to nervousness.

When the faire arrives the artifact will be exhibited in an open sided tent.

At night, the statuette is packed away into a strongbox at the foot of the headman's bed. 

The statuette is actually an empty Yuan-ti pepper mill, and is devoid of any magic.
