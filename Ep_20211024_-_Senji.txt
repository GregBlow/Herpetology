DM Rachel

The Gang reunite with Aktra, who is miserably wandering the streets of Waterdep at 4AM in drunken bitterness

Wandering into a gri all night gastropub, proprietor Senji, Ptahquin recognises Senji and a steampunk individual and immediately draws attention. The steampunk individual is revealed as Gruumsh, and their presence in the material plane is the cause of Senji's irritation. The Gang is revealed to be the cause of Gruumsh's ability to manifest, as they have a signet ring liberated from a bank vault.
