====== Rorscharch abduction ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

Mother Haggle, apropos of nothing, sudenly declares that she has a fearful premonition that badduns are going to try to steal away Caramel. Would the party go and fetch Caramel that they might be brought inside to avoid anyone getting hurt.

At this point the party can look down to the end of the paddock and see Caramel munching on grass quite happily. 

After 10 minutes or if the party moves to secure Caramel as per request a group of goblins will rush Caramel and grab the halter, pulling them back into the forest. 

The party will then be attacked from the cover of the forest unless they were in range to force the goblins to skirmish in the open.

Pursuing their quarry, the party can follow some clear tracks (3 * Survival DC: 5) through the forest . A wrong turn may lead to a dark cave containing a [[./Entities/Brown_Bear.txt|bear]] that is trying to hibernate, and will respond with acute annoyance to light. Can be heard snoring and has disadvantage on perception checks.

A failure will allow the party to backtrack to the site of their failure and resume, automatically silently succeeding on subsequent checks (Roll required).

The third and final check will  go to a [[./Entities/Net_Trap.txt|net trap]] scenario and a view of a lake in the direction of the tracks.

The party reaches the tree line and finds themselves squelching into muddy ground amongst long grass and bullrushes along the shore of a marshy lake. 

Looking down the shoreline to the left the party can see bullywugs moving amongst the bodies of goblins.
