====== Rorscharch abduction ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

Mother Haggle, apropos of nothing, sudenly declares that she has a fearful premonition that badduns are going to try to steal away Caramel. Would the party go and fetch Caramel that they might be brought inside to avoid anyone getting hurt.

At this point the party can look down to the end of the paddock and see Caramel munching on grass quite happily. 

After 10 minutes or if the party moves to secure Caramel as per request a group of goblins will rush Caramel and grab the halter, pulling them back into the forest. 

The party will then be attacked from the cover of the forest unless they were in range to force the goblins to skirmish in the open.

Pursuing their quarry, the party can follow some clear tracks (3 * Survival DC: 5) through the forest . A wrong turn may lead to a dark cave containing a [[./Entities/Brown_Bear.txt|bear]] that is trying to hibernate, and will respond with acute annoyance to light. Can be heard snoring and has disadvantage on perception checks.

A failure will allow the party to backtrack to the site of their failure and resume, automatically silently succeeding on subsequent checks (Roll required).

The third and final check will  go to a [[./Entities/Net_Trap.txt|net trap]] scenario and a view of a lake in the direction of the tracks.

The party reaches the tree line and finds themselves squelching into muddy ground amongst long grass and bullrushes along the shore of a marshy lake. 

Looking down the shoreline to the left the party can see bullywugs moving amongst the bodies of goblins, with carrion birds circling and lurking on the periphery. When the party is detected the bullywugs will attempt to retreat to the water with looted weapons and armour. The tracks, now cow and bullywug rather then cow and goblin, lead off into the distance, where a promontory of rock juts out of the forest towards the lake. At the base of this promontory is a cave the goblin party was camping in, containing a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 20 days of rations, a crowbar, 8 backpacks, bedrolls, messkits, and water skins, plus 25gp in mixed currency and 2 potions of healing and a whetstone.

Around the promontory of rock, the party finds the scene of another battle, where the bullywugs have been killed. There are feathers strewn about and the sounds of birds (harpies on a DC 15 nature check) can be heard from the cliffs above, as well as distressed sounding mooing. 

Looking about the cliffs, goats can be seen (perception DC 8) on the cliffs, and it may be possible (survival DC 13) to discern a goat path up to the ledge above. 

If the party decides to ascend by the goat path, they will have to navigate a particularly stubborn [[.\Entities\Goat.txt|goat]] that blocks the way, and refuses to move. (DC 13 Animal handling check to clear the way).

Climbing from the base is a 60 ft. climb, else from the goat obstruction 30 ft.

The sounds previously coming from the ledge die down before the party reach it, whereupon the party finds the scattered corpses of a number of harpies strewn about, and a large set of footprints leading down into the forest. (If the party looks for a gentler ascent through the forest, they'll pass these on the way up.)
